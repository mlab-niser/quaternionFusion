This work has been accepted in Proc. of the 4th International Workshop on Dialog Systems (IWDS2021) in conjunction with the IEEE BigComp2021.

The [DeepQuaternionNetworks](https://github.com/gaudetcj/DeepQuaternionNetworks) package is used for quaternion layers. 

The final code will be updated soon.
