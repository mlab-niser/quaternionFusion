The work "QUARC: Quaternion Multi-Modal Fusion Architecture For Hate Speech Classification" has been accepted in Proc. of the 4th International Workshop on Dialog Systems (IWDS2021) in conjunction with the IEEE BigComp2021. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08312)

The [DeepQuaternionNetworks](https://github.com/gaudetcj/DeepQuaternionNetworks) package is used for quaternion layers. 

The final code will be updated soon.
